# BharatOPT Mathematical Solver Architecture & Algorithms

## 1. Overview
BharatOPT is a high-performance optimization solver specifically engineered for complex downstream petroleum refining, non-linear pooling, and multi-period supply chain logistics.

## 2. Linear Programming Formulation

### 2.1 Standard Form Representation
Any linear program in BharatOPT is represented in the standard primal form:

$$\begin{aligned} \min_{x} \quad & c^T x \\ \text{s.t.} \quad & A x = b \\ & l \le x \le u \end{aligned}$$

where $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ denotes the decision variable vector, $c \in \mathbb{R}^n$ represents objective coefficients, $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is the constraint matrix with full row rank, and $l, u \in (\mathbb{R} \cup \{\pm\infty\})^n$.

### 2.2 Dual Formulation
The associated symmetric dual problem is defined as:

$$\begin{aligned} \max_{y, z_l, z_u} \quad & b^T y + l^T z_l - u^T z_u \\ \text{s.t.} \quad & A^T y + z_l - z_u = c \\ & z_l \ge 0, \quad z_u \ge 0 \end{aligned}$$

where $y \in \mathbb{R}^m$ represents dual shadow prices (multipliers), and $z_l, z_u$ are reduced costs for lower and upper bounds.
